technically, the lowest ancestor is the closest common parent of both node compare to both nodes but furthest compare to root node

clarify
-guarantee always has q, p in tree -> yes then tree will always exist
- all node value are unique? yes => if no, how to know which node is the one we want?

plan:
Find the depth of each pointer
Move the deeper pointer up until it is at the same level as the other pointer
Move each pointer up level-by-level until they meet
